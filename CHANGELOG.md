# webkms-client ChangeLog

## 9.1.0 - 2022-01-14

### Added
- Allow `maxCapabilityChainLength` to be specified when generating a key. This
  field can be used to express the maximum acceptable length of a capability
  chain associated with a capability invocation at an invocation target, i.e.,
  at a key URL.

## 9.0.0 - 2022-01-11

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Key constructors cannot be called directly when using a
  `capability`. Instead, call `.fromCapability` on the appropriate key class.
  This change allows key instances to be created asynchronously, which is
  necessary to obtain public key description information prior to using an
  asymmetric key to sign.
- **BREAKING**: `generateKey` now returns `{keyId, keyDescription}`. This
  provides the KMS ID for the key along with whatever `id` is set in the
  key description, which is the `id` for the public key (which may be
  different) from the KMS key ID.

## 8.0.1 - 2021-12-09

### Fixed
- Fix `headers` and `method` passed into `signCapabilityInvocation()`
  in `createKeystore()` and `getKeystore()`.

## 8.0.0 - 2021-12-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Update error messages, make them more specific.
  Add `cause` property to the thrown errors, and include `requestUrl` for
  timeout and network errors.

## 7.0.1 - 2021-08-27

### Fixed
- Fix internal `_assert` helper; it should have been synchronous
  but was marked async.

## 7.0.0 - 2021-07-22

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: All root zcaps use `urn:root:zcap:` prefix. Root zcaps
  for keys are the keystore root zcap where the controller resides, not
  the key. This new client version must be paired with a new WebKMS
  server, it is not compatible with an old version.
- **BREAKING**: `getKeystore` is now an instance member function instead
  of a static class member function. It requires that a capability be
  invoked to fetch the keystore config.
- **BREAKING**: The `keystore` parameter passed to `KmsClient` and
  `KeystoreAgent` constructors has been renamed to `keystoreId` to
  help avoid confusion (it is a string that contains the ID of a
  keystore, not the keystore config).
- **BREAKING**: Use simplified zcap revocation model via `revokeCapability`.
  Now any party that has delegated a zcap may revoke it by calling
  `revokeCapability` with the revoked zcap without passing an additional
  capability that targets a revocation endpoint. If no capability is passed,
  then the client will a root zcap at the `<keystoreId>/revocations/<zcap ID>`
  endpoint. The controller for this target is expected to be the delegator
  of the zcap.
- **BREAKING**: `KmsClient` functions that previously returned
  base64url-encoded results will now base64url-decode and return a
  `Uint8Array` instead. The APIs for `AsymmetricKey` and `KeyAgreementKey` will
  not be changed as they already returned a `Uint8Array` (instead, the decoding
  will just be moved to KmsClient). However, `Hmac.sign()` and `Kek.wrapKey()`
  will now return a `Uint8Array`. This change moves all encoding decisions that
  are related to the WebKMS HTTP API only inside of the `KmsClient` for
  consistency.
- **BREAKING**: Require `suiteContextUrl` be passed to `KmsClient` along with
  the key type. This allows decoupling of this library from `crypto-ld`,
  enabling them to evolve independently. This library still supports a single
  recommended key algorithm per type of key when using `KeystoreAgent`, e.g.,
  `keyAgreement`, `kek`, `hmac`, `asymmetric`.
- **BREAKING**: Creating a keystore now requires an `invocationSigner` as
  the request signs a zcap for the keystore creation endpoint as its
  invocation target.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Remove `enableCapability` and `disableCapability`. To revoke a
  delegated authorized zcap, revoke it via `revokeCapability` instead.
- **BREAKING**: Remove built-in support for older keys
  (e.g., `Ed25519Signature2018`). These can still be generated if the WebKMS
  server supports them, but their `suiteContextUrl` must be passed to
  `KmsClient.generateKey()`, they are not supported via `KeystoreAgent`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `keyType` option from `CapabilityAgent`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `findKeystores` API. It was unused, would require
  changes to work with the other changes in this new version, and its unclear
  how much of a benefit it is at this time. A redesign of this API may come
  back in a future version if it makes sense to do so.

## 6.0.0 - 2021-05-04

  `X25519KeyAgreementKey2020`) via `crypto-ld`.

## 4.0.0 - 2021-03-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Switch from using `Ed25519VerificationKey2018` key types
  to `Ed25519VerificationKey2020` for capability signing.
  See [`crypto-ld v4`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/crypto-ld/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400---2020-08-01)
